### Pre-submit:
* Write a few simple test cases if sample is not enough.
* Are the time limits close? if so, generate max cases.
* Is memory usage fine? 
* Could anything overflow
* Make sure to submit the right file.

### Wrong answer:
* Print your solution! Print debug output, as well.
* Are you clearing all data structures between test cases?
* Can your algorithm handle the whole range of input?
* Read the full problem statement again.
* Do you handle all corner cases correctly?
* Have you understood the problems correctly?
* Any uninitialized variables ?
* Any overflows?
* Confusing N and M, i and j, etc?
* Are you sure your algorithm works?
